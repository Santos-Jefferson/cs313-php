        <p>My name is Jefferson Santos, I'm from Brazil and have a big dream, to finish my Bachelor's degree at BYU-Idaho! I'm married with a wonderful wife. We have two kids and more one is coming soon. We have a company in Brazil that works with technology. We sell to the government here, and in US I think it is called procurement, or something like that!.</p>
        <p>In Brazil I already have an Associate in IT Management and many other certificates in Hardware, Linux, Microsoft, Network and etc. The majority related to infrastructured and not programming. But now, to continue my studies at BYU-Provo with a MBA I need to finish my Bachelor's in Software Engineering.</p>
        <p>I play the Piano since my 10 years old. I already wrote a book talking about my mission in Belem-PA, Brazil, called "The Missionary Journal". Actually, I'm serving as a bishop in our ward: Jardim do Sol Ward, Jardim do Sol Stake. It is my third year as a Bishop and it is a pleasure to serve to my Savior, because I can feel His Love and notice for my family and I. Well, I think it is all. Thank you for reading!</p>
